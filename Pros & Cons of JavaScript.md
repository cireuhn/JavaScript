### Pros:

1. Popularity
- Huge job market
- Very active developer ecosystem
- Language also has many libriaries for pretty much any possible functionailty instead of writing it from scratch -- made posible through NPM
	- NPM makes it very easy to find and install existing libraries into your JavaScript projects
2. It's relatively easy to learn and use
-  The time it takes to get a JavaScript program up and running is usually really short
3. Can be used for a very wide range of applications
- Used to create apps for a wide variety of platform -- such as Front-end, Back-end, and mobile devices
4. Code can be executed on the client side, which reduces the load on the server
- Since all modern web browser can run JavaScript, we can send the program to the user's browser to execute instead of rendering logic on our servers
- There are benefit and drawbacks, but it is an option in JavaScript

### Cons:

1. Worry about browser support
- Have to ensure the code we write can be ran by our users browsers
- May have to recreate and fix bugs that only happens on outdated/updated versions
2. The client has a copy of our source code
	- IE. Right-click website -> inspect
		- Go to Sources tab -> Click on Kebab Menu

- Opens up a variety of .js the website may be sending the user
2.  Third party code can make our site more vulnerable
- Third party libraries are so popular in Javascript many hackers aim to hack third parties to instantly hack a lot of websites at once; all the websites using that third party (instead of hacking an individual website)
- For instance, the hacking group Magecart was able to hack a third party shopping cart library being used by e-commerce sites to gain access credit card info and a lot of other personel information
3. Certain parts of the language can behave very strangely
- There is a GitHub repo called wtf-js that includes a pretty extensive list of JavaScript strange and sometimes paradoxical behavior in certain situations
- It also includes an explaination of why JavaScript does what it does in those situations
4. Not the best language for "Object-Oriented purists"
- If you want to get the most out of JavaScript learn about **Functional Programming** and how to incorporate it into your JavaScript applications
5. As a language, JavaScript is evolving <i>very quickly</i>
- Each of the libraries are constantly changing as well
- Different JavaScript Versions

## Summary:
Pros
- Popularity
- Simplicity
- Multi-Platform
- Client-Side Execution

Cons
- Browser-Support
- Security
- Language Oddities
- Not great for OOP
- Rapid Change
